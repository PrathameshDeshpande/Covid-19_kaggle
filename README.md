Model to predict the number of patients in a given time span at particular location 
This is a challenging model since it contains many categorical quantities. Using one hot encoding gives us a sparse matrix which is not that efficient for neural networks. Since this is the 3rd project I used a sparse matrix in DNN which gave we an accuracy of 55%.In the future, I will try to modifyÂ and update it after finding better method.
You can see the code in order to deal with date time columns in your model.
